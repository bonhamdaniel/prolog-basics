2. At the prompt, enter 'start.':
    ?- start.
3. Enter the factorial you would like computed, as prompted by the program:
    Please enter the factorial you would like to compute: 8.
4. The program will display the result of the corresponding factorial.
    The result of the computed factorial is 40320
