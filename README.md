# prolog-basics
Simple Prolog programs demonstrating the basics of the language.

The repository includes the following solutions:

1. factorial: myfactorial.pl and README.md - accepts an integer from the user, calculates the factorial of that integer, and displays the result.
2. list: mylist.pl and README.md - accepts a single integer x and a list of integers L from the user, then displays all the positions in L where x resides.
3. acyclic-path: acyclicpath.pl and README.md - accepts a graph, a start node, and an end node from the user, then displays one or more acyclic paths, if present given the parameters.
4. minimum-path: minimumpath.pl and README.md - accepts a start node, and an end node from the user, then displays the minimum-cost path found given these parameters and a graph hard-coded into the program.
5. word-syllables: wordsyllables.pl and README.md - accepts a word from the user, then divides that word into syllables based on two specified rules and displays the result.
6. farmer-problem-breadth-first: fgwc-breadth-first.pl and README.md - displays a solution to the farmer problem, including search strategy details, using a breadth-first search approach.
