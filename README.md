# prolog-basics
Simple Prolog programs demonstrating the basics of the language.

The repository includes the following solutions:

1. factorial: myfactorial.pl and README.md - accepts an integer from the user, calculates the factorial of that integer, and displays the result.
2. list: mylist.pl and README.md - accepts a single integer x and a list of integers L from the user, then displays all the positions in L where x resides.
3. acyclic-path: acyclicpath.pl and README.md - accepts a graph, a start node, and an end node from the user, then displays one or more acyclic paths, if present given the parameters.
4. minimum-path: minimumpath.pl and README.md - accepts a graph with costs associated to edges, a start node, and an end node from the user, then displays the minimum-cost path found given the parameters.
